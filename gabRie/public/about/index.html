          <p>Welcome!</p>
<p>My name is Gabrielle Magalhães Ulloa and I am currently a PhD candidate in the Graduate Program for Neuroscience at
Boston University. I&rsquo;m also a data scientist, and I intend to use this website to share about the data analysis projects
I am working on for my thesis and professional development! My thesis research is focused on the neural circuity underlying
decision-making and learning across development, particularly during the window of adolescence into adulthood.</p>
<p>I love wrangling and analyzing data, and I&rsquo;m also very passionate about scientific data sharing
and making STEM education more accessible. I am a frequent volunteer with Letters to a Prescientist, rOpenSci,
and local science fairs. I hope to get involved with more projects looking at ways to make education on statistics and STEM
more accessible to K-12 and college-level educators.</p>
