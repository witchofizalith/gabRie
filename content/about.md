Welcome! 

My name is Gabrielle Magalh√£es Ulloa and I am currently a PhD candidate in the Graduate Program for Neuroscience at 
Boston University. I intend to use this website to talk about my thesis work, STEM outreach, and ways to improve mental health care! 
My thesis research is focused on how the prefrontal neural circuity underlying learning and decision-making changes across development, particularly during the developmental window of adolescence into adulthood. 

I love wrangling and analyzing data, and I'm also very passionate about making STEM education more accessible. I hope to get involved with more projects looking at ways to make STEM education
more accessible to K-12 educators.
