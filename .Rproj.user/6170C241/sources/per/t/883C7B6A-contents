Welcome! 

My name is Gabrielle Magalh√£es Ulloa and I am currently a PhD candidate in the Graduate Program for Neuroscience at 
Boston University. I'm also a data scientist, and I intend to use this website to share about the data analysis projects
I am working on for my thesis and professional development! My thesis research is focused on the neural circuity underlying
decision-making and learning across development, particularly during the window of adolescence into adulthood. 

I love wrangling and analyzing data, and I'm also very passionate about scientific data sharing 
and making STEM education more accessible. I am a frequent volunteer with Letters to a Prescientist, rOpenSci, 
and local science fairs. I hope to get involved with more projects looking at ways to make education on statistics and STEM 
more accessible to K-12 and college-level educators. 

Here are some other places across the web you can find me:
